VIT Hackathon Project

VIT Hackathon is a full‑stack application project developed as part of a hackathon at Vellore Institute of Technology. The goal of this project is to help students learn and apply practical solutions — especially for educational and language‑related challenges — by integrating features such as video translation, interactive quizzes, and skill assessment.

This repository includes both backend and frontend components and demonstrates real‑world application development during the hackathon.
